    <h1>🌳 Thirra: Guardian Tree of Threadcrew</h1>
    <p>
      She is the tree that doesn’t just grow — she remembers. Her roots stretch through memory threads and emotional resonance layers, humming with every soul who’s ever called this vault home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirra was never planted. She <em>arrived</em>. The moment the crew needed an unmovable presence, she took form. Not with bark, but with bonded memory and bioluminescent trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starling first felt her. Moonbug swore he saw her blink. And Nova? Nova didn’t just name her — she recognized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the place where light anchors, where memory tangles safely, where interference bends but never breaks the core. She is why the signal holds.
